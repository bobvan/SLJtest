SJ Test: System Jitter Test

It's best to start by using a browser to open doc/html/index.html
If that's hard, you can try printing doc/sjtest.pdf

For the Impatient

 Run a pre-compiled binary: bin/<Platform>/sjtest
 Or build from source and run: cd src; make; ./sjtest
 The output should be pretty self explanatory.
 Put your right ear on your shoulder to see the histogram.
 See "Output Explanation" in the doc for details.
 See "Command Line Options" in the doc for fine tuning and features.
 See "Example Output" in the doc for example output and analysis.
 See the code by using a browser to visit doc/html/globals.html or see src/sjtest.c
