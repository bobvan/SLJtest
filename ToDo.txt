To Do Now
	Document build procedures for distribution and for end user
	Turn on source cross reference.
	Make plans for distributing PDF doc. (Maybe this argues against a separate intro page?)
	Is there any good place to use tables in doc?
	Insert jitter by layer graphic from Keynote into doc.
	Should I create a manpage with Doxygen and move command line options to it?
	Make uses of <tt> wrap lines properly
	Find Dave's comments and incorporate his suggested fixes.
	Incorporate sample output in doc.
	Maybe use sample output from Keynote file?

To Do in LA
	Google for sjtest before finalizing name
	Google for a jitter font and prototype a project logo
	Does Doxygen support copyright? License? Disclaimers? Acknowledgements?
	Research how to do code examples in Doxygen
	Research how to do output examples in Doxygen
	Google for Wikipedia reference to TSC.

To Do Soon
	Decide if there should be a separate Makefile for develpment and distribution
	First guess at development and distribution tree layouts
	Add doc section on optimal knee settings and advice auto printed.
	Add doc section describing a block of timestamps and loop unrolling.
	Create a new ReadMe.txt
	Add output examples and tell SJ stories
	Send a snapshot to David Riddoch for comment
	Maybe include some outlier plots in the doc?
	Cite example of BIOS PS/2 emulation causing jitter.
	Add a logo to Doxyfile
	Finalize development and distribution tree layouts
	Create git repository and commit initial versions
	Maybe get Pete to do a quick doc review?
	Check code with valgrind
	Solicit comments from Steve Ford
	Review files from concentration directory that should come over
	Spell check and read aloud

To Do Someday
	A Windows port?

Done
	Pull existing ReadMe.txt into rough cut of Doxygen documentation
	Aggregate doc content from Pages
	Figure out why doxygen can't be run from Makefile
	Decide where version number is needed and how it will be set
	Bring over version extraction code from UMERA
	Check for warnings in Doxygen output logs.
	Add Doxygen headers to getopt files.
	Fix references to "concentration" in source sjtest.c
	Fix usage of "low-level" jitter to "system" jitter
	Fix usage of "high-level" jitter to application jitter
	Fix usage of "benchmark" to "test"
	Document everything in source code.
	Add <tt> and </tt> around in-line option references.
